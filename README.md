# Sonic 2 SMS Remake Xbox

A port of the fangame **Sonic 2 SMS Remake** for the **Xbox One | Series S/X** and consequently **UWP**.

You can install the game in your **Retail Xbox (No DevMode needed)** in the following website: **https://gamr13.github.io/index.html**

Official PC and Android versions on: **sonic-sms-remake.blogspot.com**

**Some notes/Expected bugs and issues:**

1. If the game starts with black borders around, disable your overscan setting in your Xbox settings.
2. Pressing "Start" button makes the screen a little dark, pressing it again goes back to normal. This is not a bug in the game, but in the GMS UWP runner.
3. Competition has been removed.
In UWP mode, in Windows OS, it *works*, **BUT**, UWP players can't create the room for some reason. They can, however, join a room created by other system. On the Xbox however, it really doesn't work. Maybe a limitation in GMS UWP networking?
