# Sonic SMS Remake 2 Xbox

A port of the fangame **Sonic SMS Remake 2** for the **Xbox One | Series S/X** and consequently **UWP**.

You can install the game in your **Retail Xbox (No DevMode needed)** in the following website: **https://gamr13.github.io/index.html**

Official PC and Android versions on: **sonic-sms-remake.blogspot.com**

**Highlights of the latest update:**

• Fixed major memory leak **(no more crashes! \o/)**
<br>
• 60 FPS mode!
<br>
• Lots of other optimizations

**Some notes/Expected bugs and issues:**

1. If the game starts with black borders around, disable your overscan setting in your Xbox settings.
2. Pressing "Start" button makes the screen a little dark, pressing it again goes back to normal. This is not a bug in the game, but in the GMS runner.
3. Competition has been removed. Unfortunately, it does not work correctly on the Xbox.
(In UWP mode, on Windows OS, it works, BUT, players can't create the room for some reason. They can, however, join a room created by other system.)
